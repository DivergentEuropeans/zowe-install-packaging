This command will gather the hash (fingerprint) of every file in the `zowe.runtimeDirectory`.
The result is then compared with existing hashes.

For the best result, it is recommended to set all directories in `zowe.yaml` configuration,
such as `zowe.workspaceDirectory`, `zowe.logDirectory` or cetificates directories,
outside the `zowe.runtimeDirectory`.

Java is required to run the hash utility, make sure one of the following is set:
* `java.home` in `zowe.yaml` configuration
* Environment variable `JAVA_HOME`
* Environment variable `PATH`

Note: The java path is parent directory of `bin/java`.
For example, if java is at '/usr/lpp/java/current/bin/java', then set path to '/usr/lpp/java/current'.
